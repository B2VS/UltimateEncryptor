# UltimateEncryptor

An encryption algorithm can be found in ue.cpp. To encrypt here are the instructions
1. Alphabets a-z, A-Z and space are the only characters used (for input, key, output)
2. Key/Input sentence has to be a string with length (only for key: greater than equal to 20 and) less than 10,000
3. Key/Input has to be put in key.txt/Einput.txt (see example present in the files currently)
4. The program encrypts all input strings till the end of file is reached OR an incorrect input string is encountered
5. The output is generated in Eoutput.txt

The decryption is very similar to the encryption. Use the Dinput for the cyphertext. After running the program in ud.cpp, the plaintext will be generated in Doutput.txt

If there are any bugs, just notify me and I'll fix it!
