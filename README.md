# UltimateEncryptor

Here's some info
1. Alphabets a-z, A-Z and space are the only characters used (for input, key, output)
2. Key has to be a string with length greater than equal to 20 and less than sizeof(int). Write the key in a file "key.txt" in the same folder as the binary file
3. Input has to be given in a file "input.txt" in the same folder as the binary file. You can put any number of input strings (delimiter is return or new line)
4. The program encrypts all input strings till the end of file is reached OR an incorrect input string is encountered
5. The output is generated in a "output.txt" file in the same location

If there are any bugs, just notify me and I'll fix it!
